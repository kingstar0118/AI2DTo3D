TODO - GENERAL TODO LIST ACROSS PROJECT

Refactor uv_detect_and_fill script with functions.
Identify top left corner for each uv face. Label with appropriate side.


Fill in GitHub project description & add graphics. Provide better snapshot of current project state, future steps and stretch goals.

Gather all fbx from folder into Blender.
Randomly place models in Blender scene in small area.

Randomly place fbx in Unity in small area (repeat of Blender option)
Randomly place fbx in Unreal in small area (repeat of Blender option)

Import full scene randomized fbx into Lens Studio for Snapchat.

Adapt code to allow a dynamic number of images from 1-6 (currently MUST be given 4 images).

Create "sphere primitive" version, isolating a spherical image from a MidjourneyAI image. Clone front and back.
Blend edges of UV face using image processing.

=======
COMPLETED:
Refactor uv_detect_smallest_distance script with functions.

Create texture file from uv.
  - scale MidjourneyAI images to match uv face size.
  - attach images to texture file at uv faces.

Apply the cube texture png to a cube mesh via code and export as fbx.
Refactor to main.py, to run through all scripts automatically. Input a 4 image Midjourney png, output a cube texture png.  (With compromise that can't be completely automatic, requires both external python script and blender script.)
Apply images to correct cube faces.
Apply correct rotation to cube face images.

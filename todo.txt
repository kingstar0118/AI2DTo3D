TODO - GENERAL TODO LIST ACROSS PROJECT

Refactor uv_detect_and_fill script with functions.
Identify top left corner for each uv face. Label with appropriate side.


Fill in GitHub project description & add graphics. Provide better snapshot of current project state, future steps and stretch goals.

Apply images to correct cube faces.
Apply correct rotation to cube face images. 



Adapt code to allow a dynamic number of images from 1-6 (currently MUST be given 4 images).

=======
COMPLETED:
Refactor uv_detect_smallest_distance script with functions.

Create texture file from uv.
  - scale MidjourneyAI images to match uv face size.
  - attach images to texture file at uv faces.

Apply the cube texture png to a cube mesh via code and export as fbx.
Refactor to main.py, to run through all scripts automatically. Input a 4 image Midjourney png, output a cube texture png.  (With compromise that can't be completely automatic, requires both external python script and blender script.)
